              <h2>Top Projects</h2>
              <h3>Sky Gazer</h3>
              <p>In this project, I and 3 individuals used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create Sky Gazer. In Sky Gazer, the user will input a location and choose one satellite, among a list of satellites, and the site will return the time and dates for the next fly over for the course of the next seven days, and will pair with weather data to determine if the user will be able to see the satellite when it flies over in their chosen location.
                <br>
                Check it out here: <a href="https://pamtheham.github.io/Sky-Gazer/"><i class="fab fa-github-square"></i></a>
              </p>
              <h3>Password Generator</h3>
              <p>In this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a password generator. The password generator is able to collect information from the user in order to determine the parameters of the password, including a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters and the choice of at least one type of character: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers, though the user may choose all four types. When that information is collected, the user presses on the "Generate Password" button, and a password that fits their specified criteria is written on the page.
                <br>

              </p>
              <h3>Coding Quiz</h3>
              <p>In this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a timed quiz that will test your Javascript fundamentals. The user has 100 seconds to answer five questions about JavaScript fundamentals. If the user selects an incorrect answer, then 10 seconds is subtracted from the overall time.
